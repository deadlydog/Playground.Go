This is just a a place for me to play around with Go.

Following [the W3Schools Go tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/go/).

## Installation / Setup

1. Install Go from <https://golang.org/dl/>, or from the Windows command line just use the command `winget install -e --id GoLang.Go`.
1. Install [the `Go` VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go).
1. Run the `Go: Install/Update Tools` command in VS Code.
